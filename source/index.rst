Open Data Manager user guide
##############################

Our **Open Data Manager (ODM)** workspace increases the productivity of all
kinds of data-related projects across Life Sciences - from Agritech to
Genomics. With so much breadth, it’s easy to get confused as to what exactly we
do regarding **Data Management** and **File Management**. You might even think
they’re two peas in a pod. Trust us, we get it - the two terms seem purely
semantic (and maybe a little pedantic!) - yet there are core fundamental
differences between the two!

**File Management** is present across a breadth of industries large and small;
however, when scientific data is involved - it simply just isn’t sufficient.
Why? Check out `our article here`_ to learn about the **Data Management**
approach and its advantages.

**Important! Data Management**  has requirements, shown in this short video.
`Get familiar with ODM basics`_.

With an understanding of **Data Management** under the belt, the next question
is onboarding. When considering what ODM can do for you; *context is key*. What
kind of user are you? An admin, a data contributor, a data consumer? All three?
We have onboarding guides for each flow below.

User Admins
-----------

User management and administration can be grueling work when attempting without
the proper software to help you on the path! Find out how ODM makes
administration easy below.

`In this video`_ you will find out:

* Who are the two user classes: contributors and consumers
* How to create users and assign permissions
* How to create user groups and assign curator groups
* How to enable sharing and editing


Guide for data contributors
----------------------------

ODM’s main purpose for your contributors is to get them straight into all of
the data available at your organization via a single access point. Data
however, can still come from different sources; be it outside the organization
or from within, generated by different teams and even through legacy data!

To make your data findable, you need to pass it through a curation (*aka*
harmonization) procedure by *applying defined guidelines to your datasets* in
order to make them easy for anyone with access to reach at any time!

Still unsure? Learn more by watching our videos below.

* `What a data template is`_
* `How to work with dictionaries and ontologies`_
* `How to create a Study and upload your data`_
* `How to curate your data`_



Guide for data consumers
------------------------

Those who are data all-consuming have one goal in mind when using ODM - generating that key insight!

* `How to unlock the power of ODM with the advanced usage of APIs`_
