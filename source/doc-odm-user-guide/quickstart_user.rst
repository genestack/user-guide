As a regular user the main tasks of interest are searching and browsing studies. Clicking on the **Browse studies**
link from the dashboard takes you to the Study Browser to help you do this.

By default, the system displays all studies that you have permission to access.
However, since there could be thousands of studies, it provides search and filtering options to help you find the ones that you are interested in. 
You can find these options in the left-hand panel of the Study Browser. 
They allow you to search by study name, accession, or any metadata field that contains relevant text.

    !!! note
        Harmonising your study and sample data (metadata) texts by using controlled vocabularies and ontologies helps searches find all relevant data by preventing missed results due to misspellings or non-standard term usage.

The search is also controlled vocabulary/ontology aware and will expand results to include synonyms, with optional extension to include child terms. You can use asterisks (*) to allow any positive number of wildcard characters: "*ale" will find "male" and "female" for example. Click on the question mark next to the search bar to open **Help** with more details about advanced search functionality.

The facets beneath the search bar allow you to filter down the results of a search based on the samaple data (metadata) fields that
are present in your results.

To access more details about a study and to explore it further click the name of the study which will launch
the Metadata Editor in a new tab.
